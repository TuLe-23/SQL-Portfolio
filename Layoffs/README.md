# Dataset Details
This dataset was from the [Layoffs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022/data) by swaptr. It entails the tech layoffs starting from March 11, 2020 (when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic), to present.

# Project Overview
I prepared the raw dataset through standard cleaning processes, and analyzed the resulting data to identify trends and create insights from it. My main goal was to understand the impact of COVID-19 and the distribution of layoffs across the tech industry.
